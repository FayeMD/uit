# Contributing: Guidelines

### README.md

- Each folder should have a README.md file describing the content.
- UIT's main README.md should not contain external links (only links to files/folders).

### Links

- Each link should contain the title and a description of the content.
- In the description, give students context about why the link is useful. This will help them decide if they need to read it.
