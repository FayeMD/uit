For this project you will learn how to deploy software to a cloud based server, buy a domain name, configure dns, and ssh into the server. This blog will be updated throughout the year as you complete projects, discover new resources, or if you just want to share your excitement with a recent breakthrough. Ghost will be used as your publishing platform, and DigitalOcean as your Cloud Server.

- Install Ghost locally.
- Go to DigitalOcean and create an account.
- Use the promotion code we provide and create a droplet
- Deploy Ghost on Ubuntu.
- Purchase a domain name and configure your name servers (NS records) to point to Cloudflare DNS.
- Configure your DNS to point your A Records to your digital ocean IP Address:
- Generate a SSH Key for your new server and connect to the Digital Ocean remote server.
- Login to your blog.
- Write a blog post about what you learned and the overall experience.
