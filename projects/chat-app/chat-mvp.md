##Chat MVP

For this week you will finish your chat application features, host it on digital ocean, and live demo your chat. Most of you elaborated on the chat features you wished to implement when Permjot visited, if you didn't pitch a feature for your chat, develop something that sets your chat apart from the others.

We will have Goinstant developer, Jeff Anderson, do a presentation and question period on Wednesday over Skype.
You should have a good idea of the questions you would like to ask him to help you get over hurdles that will surely arise when you start to implement your feature
