##Chat MVP

For this week you will finish your chat application features, host it on digital ocean, and live demo your chat. Most of you elaborated on the chat features you wished to implement when Permjot visited, if you didn't pitch a feature for your chat, you will develop something that makes your chat different.

We will have Goinstant developer, Jeff Anderson, do a presentation and question period on Wednesday
