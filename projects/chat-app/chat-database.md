#Chat Server

##Description

In this project you will be implementing a chat history function which will load once someone joins the chat. You can also implement a search function that will search for keywords in the database.


##Instructions

Create a [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) or [branch](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) of your `simple-chat-server` repo and rename the clone to whatever you see fit for this project, for example `mynt-chat-database`.

Review the Redis resources provided below to get started developing your database.

Create a database that will pull information the users have input and store the data to be viewed in a chat history.
