#Contributing Guidelines

- Simplest way is to create a [New Issue](https://github.com/uit/uit/issues/new) and put the link to the content there with a short desciption of why it's useful and we'll do the rest.
- **OR** [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) this repo and after adding new links to it, make a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
- **OR** you can send gavinmail@gmail.com an email with the subject of [UIT Content](mailto:gavinmail@gmailcom?subject=UIT%20Content:).

## Project Root
The project root should have a ```README.md``` file

1. Describe the curriculum
2. Help students get started
 - Introduce the main topics and why they are important.
 - Link each topic to a folder (no external links).
3. Help contributors get started
 - Describe who can help and why it is important.

## Folders
Each folder should have a simple name and a ```README.md``` file

1. Describe the topic
2. Introduce subjects
 - Introduce each subject and why they are important.
 - Link each subject to a file

## Files
Each file should have a simple name

1. Describe the subject
2. Link to external content
 - Each link should contain the title and a description of the content.
 - In the description, give students context about why the link is useful. This will help them decide if they need to read it.
