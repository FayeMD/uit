###Introducing, UIT
An open-source curriculum for aspiring founders developed by technology professionals and proven entrepreneurs.

####We Can Improve Technology and Business Education

Everything an aspiring founder needs to build their startup is online - Including how to code, acquire users, and raise money - It’s all there. The tricky part is in knowing what to search for, and what is worth reading. With years of experience, we know what’s important to learn, and we know the best resources. We can pool our collective knowledge into an open-source startup curriculum, based purely on existing, freely available content.

######_How Can You Help?_

Submitting tutorials, blogs, videos, courses, etc. Anything that is useful.


####About UIT

UIT is a non-profit foundation that will work in partnership with existing education, like Education Departments, Universities, and Incubators. Starting in September 2014, Cape Breton University will be the first to offer the curriculum in partnership with Volta.

The program will accept 10 students who will spend 11 months learning to start their own company. They’ll be awarded 45 BBA credits from CBU (37.5% of a degree!). Aided by the open-source curriculum and Volta’s network of mentors, they’ll each build 10 applications across different industries and technologies. Every app they create will be hosted on their public profile, including source code, pitch deck, and blog posts about their learning experience. Ultimately, they’ll identify an opportunity that inspires them to launch a real startup.
